        <h1>Our Love Story</h1>
        <p>
          “The first time I met her I cracked a joke immediately. I was very
          nervous and that’s why I cracked a joke because I didn’t know what to
          do. I was standing on sets and was being all nervous and jittery. I
          thought I was being funny (when I cracked that joke), and I said
          something which wasn’t probably the right thing to say. She is tall
          and she was wearing heels (makes a gesture which isn’t too much) and
          she was being told that I am not that tall, I am not 6 feet plus or
          something... she walked in with heels and was looking taller than me
          and I was like didn’t you get a higher pair of heels. Then she was
          like ‘excuse me’ and then I was like ‘no, I am just joking’. My joke
          became such a weird moment for myself. I was such a fool, to be
          honest. She was so confident, she is on sets regularly.”

          On their first date, he said, “It was pretty traditional; we would go
          out for meals. Eventually you didn’t really have to ask out because
          both of us knew we liked spending time with each other. I don’t even
          remember when we thought ‘okay this is the time when the transition is
          happening’, it was so organic and natural. And it kept getting
          stronger and stronger. We knew that we just wanted to be with each
          other.”
